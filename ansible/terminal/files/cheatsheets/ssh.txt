Create a key without having to go through the interactive menu[1][2]

  ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/my.key -t rsa -b 4096 -C my_comment


Copying the key to a server that you have access to. This is useful for if
you are rotating your SSH key (i.e. putting the new one onto the server and
then deleting the old one)

  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/my.key user@remote


Alternatively, you could do it the long way/manually.
- copy ~/.ssh/my.key.pub to clipboard (or email it or write it down...)
- then append it to remote:/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys

If you get an error like this:

  sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation

It's probably because you have enabled the 'Require user confirmation when
this key is used'[3][4] option in KeePassXC or your keys need stricter
permission. If it's the permissions thing then:

  chmod 600 my.key
  chmod 644 my.key.pub


Here is some info re: using the SSH Agent[5]

  # start SSH-Agent
  ubuntu@node01:~$ eval $(ssh-agent)
  Agent pid 1592

  # add Identity
  ubuntu@node01:~$ ssh-add
  Enter passphrase for /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa:
  Identity added: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa (ubuntu@dlp.srv.world)

  # confirm
  ubuntu@node01:~$ ssh-add -l
  3072 SHA256:8c0JKIhM5yPk6Kd2YloCsiKOKKjqPu5Qcot94/buwEg ubuntu@dlp.srv.world (RSA)

  # try to connect with SSH without passphrase
  ubuntu@node01:~$ ssh dlp.srv.world hostname
  dlp.srv.world

  # exit from SSH-Agent
  ubuntu@node01:~$ eval $(ssh-agent -k)
  Agent pid 1592 killed
