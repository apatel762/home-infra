# The folders where we can store our custom chromium policy.
#
# Ordinarily, the browsers will only pick stuff up from these folders
# if the browsers are installed to the host system directly, but thanks
# to some clever workaround from the Flatpak maintainers (symlinks) we
# can drop our policies into these folders and they will be brought
# into the container sandbox for us.
#
# Also, it's worth noting, the JSON file approach of managing policy
# only works on Linux. It's a bit more complex on Windows and MacOS (I
# think).
