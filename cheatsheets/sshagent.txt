SSH Agent
=========

Make sure that you have your SSH agent loaded. If it isn't, then use
the commands below to get it set up:

  eval $(ssh-agent)              # to start up the agent
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/github.key      # or whatever your key is called
  ssh -T git@github.com          # to test your connection
