# Firefox

I use some customisations for Firefox that can't easily be worked into the Ansible config, so I will document them here.

## Dependencies

I'm using the `WhiteSur-gtk-theme` to skin Firefox, specifically the MacOS Monterey style. This repo has been added as a submodule with the following steps:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme whitesur
```
