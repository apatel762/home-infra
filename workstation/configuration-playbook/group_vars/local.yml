# =====================================================================
# Layered packages
#
# These should be used sparingly to install stuff that needs to be
# available system-wide and can't be used via toolboxes or Flatpak.

# Flatpaks

# All apps installed on the machine should come from here so that they
# can easily be installed into your home dir and have their updates
# managed by the OS.
