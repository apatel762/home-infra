There are some steps that must be completed manually. They only need to be completed once.

1. Partition hard drives during OS installation.
2. Create a user.
3. Connect the bluetooth keyboard via the 'Bluetooth' menu in the Settings app.
4. Change the device `hostname` via the 'About' menu in the Settings app.
5. Install updates via the GNOME software app and reboot if necessary.

## Bootstrapping

Run the `bootstrap0.sh` script.

This script will create a toolbox container. Enter the container and follow the rest of the instructions, which can be found using the links at the top of this page.
