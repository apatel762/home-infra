# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They are intended for use on Linux and probably won't work on MacOS or WSL2 (Windows).

## Installation

**Use the provided `install` script** to create symlinks for all the config files and read the below information to make sure that everything is set up properly (because you may need to manually add stuff to `.bashrc` to make it all work).

```
./install
```

## `.bashrc`

TODO: Automate this step gh-56

The `.bashrc.d/` folder holds all of the parts of what would be my `.bashrc`. To use it, copy the entire folder to `$HOME` and ensure that the below snippet is in the default `.bashrc` somewhere:

```bash
# User specific aliases and functions
if [ -d ~/.bashrc.d ]; then
	for rc in ~/.bashrc.d/*; do
		if [ -f "$rc" ]; then
			. "$rc"
		fi
	done
fi

unset rc
```
