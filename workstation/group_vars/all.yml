# All apps installed on the machine should come from here so that they
# can easily be installed into your home dir and have their updates
# managed by the OS.

# difficult to install as Flatpaks).
#
# Each application is fully contained in one file (realistically, this
# means that the applications are all 'AppImage' files).
