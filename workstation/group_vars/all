# Layered packages

# These should be used sparingly to install stuff that needs to be
# available system-wide and can't be used via toolboxes or Flatpak.

# Flatpaks
#
# All apps installed on the machine should come from here so that they
# can easily be installed into your home dir and have their updates
# managed by the OS.

# Standalone Applications
#
# These are applications that can't be found as Flatpaks (or are
# difficult to install as Flatpaks).
#
# Each application is fully contained in one file (realistically, this
# means that the applications are all 'AppImage' files).
