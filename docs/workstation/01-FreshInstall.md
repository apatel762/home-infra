To create the disk image, I usually use the 'Fedora Media Writer' app. It can download a Fedora Silverblue image and put it onto the USB drive for you.

There are some steps that must be completed manually. They only need to be completed once.

1. Partition hard drives during OS installation.
2. Create a user.
3. Connect the bluetooth keyboard via the 'Bluetooth' menu in the Settings app.
4. Change the device `hostname` via the 'About' menu in the Settings app.
5. Install updates via the GNOME software app and reboot if necessary.
